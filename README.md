# About the files:

1.`"iter-mpi-matrix-vector.py"` is the iterative approach to matrix vector multiplication using numpy and MPI4py library.

2.`"mpi-matrix-vector.py"` is a similar approach using different methods to divide the vector.

3.The two `".npy"` files are auto generated by the code and are just storage boxes for the matrices and vectors used in our code.


# Iter-mpi-matrix-vetor.py:

The code can be run using the following command:

`$mpirun -n 4 python Iter-mpi-matrix-vetor.py`

-argument following '-n' is a integer that defines the number of parallel processors to run the code logic on.
-prints out the running time of each node
-code consists of comments.


# StarCluster and Mpich2 Configurations:
Following are the configurations that the StarCluster on our EC2 instance is running on. 

These values can be changed in the `".starcluster/Config"` file under [aws info]:

[aws info]  

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID =#your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = #your_secret_access_key
AWS_USER_ID=#your userid

[key mykey]
KEY_LOCATION=~/.ssh/mykey.rsa

[cluster smallcluster]
KEYNAME = mykey
CLUSTER_SIZE = 8
CLUSTER_USER = sgeadmin
CLUSTER_SHELL = bash
NODE_IMAGE_ID = ami-3393a45a
NODE_INSTANCE_TYPE = t1.micro
MASTER_INSTANCE_TYPE = t1.micro
PLUGINS = mpich2

# How to run the program:

1.Log into th EC2 instance using: `$ssh -i my_key.pem host@server-name`

2.Start your already created cluster by using: `$starcluster start -x cluster-name`

3.If you have previously not created a cluster use this: `$starcluster start cluster-name` 

4.Once cluster has started type: `$su - sgeadmin`

5.Now you may run your .py file using the method stated under `Iter-mpi-matrix-vetor.py` heading of this page.
